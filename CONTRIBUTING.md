# Contributing to this project
Initially, I'd like to thank you for the contribution on behalf of myself (Ryftrr), as well as my friend Connor who created version 1.0.0a and made this project possible!

Also, please remember that these guidelines are not the law of this project, but they do matter and it would be unwise not to
follow them.  That said, every document in the project is a dynamic file and we are always open to suggestions and proposed changes.

#### Code of Conduct
By participating, you are effectively governed by the code of conduct for this project.
Please follow it closely and feel free to report anyone who isn't to Ryan Cole (ryftrr@gmail.com).
> You may also contact me with questions.

### What to know before you start contributing
This project is currently quite small and doesn't require much alteration besides bug fixes at this time.
However, if you are interested in adding features or have an idea, please feel free to propose such changes.
It's not guaranteed to be implemented but it will be considered and certainly appreciated!

### How to contribute

##### Reporting bugs
Please, above all, make sure you aren't reporting a bug that has already been reported.
**If it's a known bug:**
+ Comment on the existing issue
+ If it's still not fixed after a while, contact me (ryftrr@gmail.com)
**If it's a new bug:**
+ Use a clear and descriptive title that synopsizes the issue
+ Explain _exactly_ how the bug was made to occur (the steps you did before it happened) and be very detailed on the way in which those steps where taken (i.e. key press, mouse move, etc.)
+ Link to potentially bugged code blocks, and use Markdown tokens to annotate properly
> You do not have to submit a markdown copy-paste of the code, but use the tokens if you do
+ Explain the expected behavior and actual behavior within the instance
+ Screenshots/Gif/Short Videos help tremendously in trying to replicate the bug for squashing; if you can, provide one
+ Provide a crash report if it's applicable and possible
+ If any of these steps are difficult to explain (i.e. if you didn't do something specific that triggered it, you can't find proper code blocks to link, etc.), do your best
> Remember, these are guidelines, not an ultimatum
Please also include the name and version of your OS, as well as any other technical details that could be relevant.
##### Suggesting features
If you'd like to see something in the game that you don't see yet, please email me or Connor with the following:
+ What you call the feature (include in subject line)
+ How it would improve the game
+ Example pseudo-code for the addition
Remember, you aren't guaranteed to see your feature in the game, but you'll receive credit if you do.
##### Fixing bugs
If you've fixed a known bug, please alert me or Connor via email with a link to the issue report and promising proof of the fix.
If the bug is _not_ already in the issues reports, please first submit one for the bug and then complete the rest of the steps.

### Style Guides
##### Git commit messages
+ Use present tense verbs
> i.e. "Add" instead of "Added"
+ Use imperative style
> i.e. "Change" not "Changes"
+ Limit the title line to <= 64 characters
+ Use the secondary lines to reference specific issues, pull requests, etc.
+ If you haven't touched the code and are changing documentation only, denote that clearly within square brackets
##### Issues
+ Start the title with square brackets enclosing the type of issue
> see Miscellaneous
+ Use proper english conventions
##### Python script
Try to match our style.  It won't be perfect, but at least make an attempt.  Comment often as well.
